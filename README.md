# Markdown
Markdown is an easy-to-use markup language that is used with plain text to add formatting elements (headings, bulleted lists, URLs) to plain text without using a formal text editor or HTML tags. Markdown is device-agnostic and displays the writing format consistently across device types.

This repository contains code files regarding how to add different basic components to a markdown file.
